# KerasCV Image Preprocessing and Visualization

This project demonstrates a simple pipeline using **KerasCV** for image loading, preprocessing, and visualization. It includes steps for resizing images while preserving aspect ratio, using TensorFlow as the backend.

## Features

- ✅ KerasCV with TensorFlow backend  
- ✅ Image loading and visualization  
- ✅ Preprocessing with resizing and aspect ratio padding  
- ✅ Ready for future object detection / computer vision workflows  

## Installation

Make sure to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install keras-cv
```

You may also need:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled5.ipynb
```

Or open it in Google Colab for easy execution.

## Project Structure

- `Untitled5.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code and visualizations
- Image preprocessing includes:
  - Image loading from local file
  - Visualization using `keras_cv.visualization`
  - Resizing with padding using `keras_cv.layers.Resizing`

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholder image paths (like `"download.png"`) with your actual image file.
- The notebook is a starting point for more advanced workflows like object detection using bounding boxes.
